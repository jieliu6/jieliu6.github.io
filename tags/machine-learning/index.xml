      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human epigenome and transcription activities have been characterized by a number of sequence-based deep learning approaches which only utilize the DNA sequences. However, transcription factors interact with each other, and their collaborative regulatory activities go beyond the linear DNA sequence. Therefore leveraging the informative 3D chromatin organization to investigate the collaborations among transcription factors is critical. We developed ECHO, a graph-based neural network, to predict chromatin features and characterize the collaboration among them by incorporating 3D chromatin organization from 200-bp high-resolution Micro-C contact maps. ECHO predicted 2,583 chromatin features with significantly higher average AUROC and AUPR than the best sequence-based model. We observed that chromatin contacts of different distances affected different types of chromatin features&amp;rsquo; prediction in diverse ways, suggesting complex and divergent collaborative regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, ECHO was interpretable via gradient-based attribution methods. The attributions on chromatin contacts identify important contacts relevant to chromatin features. The attributions on DNA sequences identify TF binding motifs and TF collaborative binding. Furthermore, combining the attributions on contacts and sequences reveals important sequence patterns in the neighborhood which are relevant to a target sequence&amp;rsquo;s chromatin feature prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EPCOT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many deep learning approaches have been proposed to predict epigenetic profiles, chromatin organization, and transcription activity. While these approaches achieve satisfactory performance in predicting one modality from another, the learned representations are not generalizable across predictive tasks or across cell types. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach named EPCOT which employs a pre-training and fine-tuning framework, and comprehensively predicts epigenome, chromatin organization, transcriptome, and enhancer activity in one framework. EPCOT is the first framework proposed to predict all of these genomic modalities and performs well in individual modality prediction, which is also generalizable to new cell and tissue types. EPCOT also maps from DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility profiles to generic representations which are generalizable across different modalities. Interpreting EPCOT model also provides biological insights including mapping between different genomic modalities, identifying TF sequence binding patterns, and analyzing cell-type specific TF impacts on enhancer activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The resolution of chromatin conformation capture technologies keeps increasing, and the recent nucleosome resolution chromatin contact maps allow us to explore how fine-scale 3D chromatin organization is related to epigenomic states in human cells. Using publicly available Micro-C datasets, we develop a deep learning model, CAESAR, to learn a mapping function from epigenomic features to 3D chromatin organization. The model accurately predicts fine-scale structures, such as short-range chromatin loops and stripes, that Hi-C fails to detect. With existing epigenomic datasets from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics Project, we successfully impute high-resolution 3D chromatin contact maps for 91 human tissues and cell lines. In the imputed high-resolution contact maps, we identify the spatial interactions between genes and their experimentally validated regulatory elements, demonstrating CAESAR’s potential in coupling transcriptional regulation with 3D chromatin organization at high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>single-cell multi-omics integration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many single-cell sequencing technologies are now available, but it is still difficult to apply multiple sequencing technologies to the same single cell. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised manifold alignment algorithm, MMD-MA, for integrating multiple measurements carried out on disjoint aliquots of a given population of cells. Effectively, MMD-MA performs an in silico co-assay by embedding cells measured in different ways into a learned latent space. In the MMD-MA algorithm, single-cell data points from multiple domains are aligned by optimizing an objective function with three components: (1) a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) term to encourage the differently measured points to have similar distributions in the latent space, (2) a distortion term to preserve the structure of the data between the input space and the latent space, and (3) a penalty term to avoid collapse to a trivial solution. Notably, MMD-MA does not require any correspondence information across data modalities, either between the cells or between the features. Furthermore, MMD-MA&amp;rsquo;s weak distributional requirements for the domains to be aligned allow the algorithm to integrate heterogeneous types of single cell measures, such as gene expression, DNA accessibility, chromatin organization, methylation, and imaging data. We demonstrate the utility of MMD-MA in simulation experiments and using a real data set involving single-cell gene expression and methylation data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>scHi-C embedding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data promises to enable scientists to interrogate the 3D architecture of DNA in the nucleus of the cell, studying how this structure varies stochastically or along developmental or cell cycle axes.  However, Hi-C data analysis requires methods that take into account the unique characteristics of this type of data.  In this work, we explore whether methods that have been developed previously for the analysis of bulk Hi-C data can be applied to scHi-C data.  We apply methods designed for analysis of bulk Hi-C data to scHi-C data in conjunction with unsupervised embedding.  We find that one of these methods, HiCRep, when used in conjunction with multidimensional scaling (MDS), strongly outperforms three other methods, including a technique that has been used previously for scHi-C analysis.  We also provide evidence that the HiCRep/MDS method is robust to extremely low per-cell sequencing depth, that this robustness is improved even further when high-coverage and low-coverage cells are projected together, and that the method can be used to jointly embed cells from multiple published datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Testing Under Dependence</title>
      <link>https://jieliu6.github.io/project/multiple-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Observations from large-scale multiple testing problems often exhibit dependence in the sense that whether the null hypothesis of one test is true or not (termed &lt;em&gt;underlying true state&lt;/em&gt;) depends on the underlying true states of other tests. 
For instance, in genome-wide association studies, researchers collect hundreds of thousands of highly correlated genetic markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) with the purpose of identifying the subset of markers associated with a heritable disease or trait. 
In functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, thousands of spatially correlated voxels are collected while subjects are performing certain tasks, with the purpose of detecting the relevant voxels. 
The most popular family of large-scale multiple testing procedures is the false discovery rate analysis. 
However, all these classical multiple testing procedures ignore the correlation structure among the individual factors, and the question is &lt;em&gt;whether we can reduce the false non-discovery rate by leveraging the dependence, while still controlling the false discovery rate in multiple testing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphical models provide an elegant way of representing dependence. 
With recent advances in graphical models, especially more efficient algorithms for inference and parameter estimation, it is feasible to use these models to leverage the dependence between individual tests in multiple testing problems. 
More specifically, we can use graphical models to explicitly model the underlying true states of the hypotheses as random variables to encode the dependence, and then model the observed test statistics independently given their underlying true states. 
We propose a multiple testing procedure based on a Markov-random-field-coupled mixture model which allows arbitrary dependence structures. 
In our model, the underlying true states of the hypotheses form a Markov random field, and the observed test statistics are assumed to be independent given the underlying true states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/TED-1.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model requires more sophisticated algorithms for parameter estimation and inference. 
For parameter estimation, we design a novel EM algorithm with MCMC in the E-step and a contrastive divergence style algorithm in the M-step. 
We show that there is a lower bound of the log likelihood which nondecreases over the EM iterations except for some MCMC error introduced in the E-step. 
We use the MCMC algorithm to infer the posterior probability that each hypothesis is null (termed &lt;em&gt;local index of significance&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;LIS&lt;/em&gt;). 
Finally, the false discovery rate can be controlled by thresholding the LIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we design a semiparametric variation of the graphical model which nonparametrically estimates the $f_1$ function &amp;mdash; the density function of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis. 
This is particularly important in some practical problems where $f_1$ is heterogeneous among multiple hypotheses, and cannot be estimated with a simple parametric distribution. 
The remainder of the graphical model is still estimated parametrically. 
The inference of the posterior probability and the false discovery rate control in this semiparametric variation remain the same as the parametric procedure.
More important, this semiparametric approach exactly generalizes the local FDR procedure (Efron et al., 2001) and connects with the BH procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor Heterogeneity Anaysis</title>
      <link>https://jieliu6.github.io/project/themis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer is heterogeneous in the sense that the cancer cells in a tumor are not genetically identical, but form distinct clones, defined as subpopulations of cancer cells that host the same genomic aberrations&lt;/strong&gt;. 
In aggressive and metastatic cancers, these genomic aberrations quickly evolve, resulting in extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity (Shah et al. 2012, Nowell 1976). 
Therefore, multiple biopsies over different locations and at different time points need to be collected and sequenced in order to capture the complexity of tumor genomic landscapes and provide insight into how tumors evolve and escape treatment (Gerlinger et al. 2014, Frampton et al. 2013). 
Accordingly, computational tools are needed to accurately characterize the clonal structure of cancer and reveal how that structure evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a large number of computational tools and statistical models have been developed to analyze tumor heterogeneity from DNA sequencing data. 
However, &lt;strong&gt;most of these tools only model one type of genomic aberration&lt;/strong&gt;, such as single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), or structural variants. 
Restricting the analysis to a single type of mutation not only reduces statistical power to accurately detect the clonal structure within the tumor, but also prevents us from understanding interactions among different types of mutations. 
Furthermore, many SNV-based methods assume that no copy number changes have occurred, which is extremely improbable. 
Therefore, their estimation of the prevalence of a given clone can be inaccurate, and the corresponding heterogeneity results may be misleading. 
Existing methods that capture SNVs and CNAs in the same model (i.e., phyloWGS from Deshwar et al. 2015, SPRUCE from El-Kebir et al. 2015, and Canopy from Jiang et al. 2016) require running a CNA-calling algorithm before heterogeneity analysis, but accurate CNA characterization also depends on heterogeneity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most existing tools are &lt;strong&gt;designed to analyze a single tumor biopsy and are not suitable for jointly analyzing multiple biopsies&lt;/strong&gt;. 
As DNA sequencing becomes more affordable, we can more easily collect multiple biopsies from a single patient during treatment. 
If we only perform heterogeneity analysis on the individual biopsies, then we are unable to detect clones that are shared across different biopsies from the same patient, and we fail to address important questions about how the tumor cells evolve, metastasize and escape treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, although most of models are free and publicly available, it is &lt;strong&gt;difficult to extend them by adding new assumptions and new types of biological data&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Even under the best of circumstances, significant effort is required for users to fully understand the source code. 
In many situations, data structures and computational algorithms prohibit other investigators from modifying the model to accommodate their special needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/THEMIS-1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, &lt;strong&gt;we propose THEMIS (Tumor Heterogeneity Extensible Modeling via an Integrative System), which allows us to jointly characterize different types of genomic aberrations from multiple biopsies using a dynamic graphical model&lt;/strong&gt; (in figure above). 
We implement our model via an extensible modeling platform, the Graphical Models Toolkit (GMTK) (Bilmes and Zweig 2002), which makes our approach open, reproducible and easy for others to extend. 
To extend the model, users only have to modify the model specification files; GMTK then automatically handles the required computation. 
Simulation experiments demonstrate that THEMIS significantly increases the accuracy of recovering tumor subclones and their genotypes, compared with its ancestor, TITAN (Ha et al. 2012). 
Single cell DNA sequencing confirms that individual nuclei can be segregated into one of the two tumor subclones identified by THEMIS. 
We applied THEMIS to three tumor biopsies from one cancer patient, thereby revealing the mutation accumulation history of the patient, tracking cancer progression, and identifying mutations related to developing resistance following various treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
