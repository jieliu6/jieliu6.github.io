Therefore, it is critical to accurately and efficiently identify cellular neighborhoods from spatially-resolved single-cell transcriptomic data or single-cell resolution tissue imaging data.

It includes state-of-the-art cellular neighborhood identification methods and post-identification smoothing techniques, with our newly proposed Cellular Neighbor Embedding (CNE) method and Naive Smoothing technique, as well as several established downstream analysis approaches. We applied CNTools on three real-world CODEX datasets and evaluated identification methods with smoothing techniques quantitatively and qualitatively.

For example, the basilar membrane stiffness changes tonotopically, thus affecting the tuning properties of individual hair cells. At the molecular level, those frequency-specific characteristics are mirrored by gene expression gradients; however, the molecular mechanisms controlling tonotopic gene expression in the mouse cochlea remain elusive. Through analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from E12.5 and E14.5 time points, we predicted that morphogens, rather than a cell division-associated mechanism, confer spatial identity in the extending cochlea. Subsequently, we reconstructed the developing cochlea in 3D space from scRNA-seq data to investigate the molecular pathways mediating positional information. The retinoic acid (RA) and hedgehog pathways were found to form opposing apex-to-base gradients, and functional interrogation using mouse cochlear explants suggested that both pathways jointly specify the longitudinal axis.","tags":null,"title":"3D reconstruction of the mouse cochlea from scRNA-seq data suggests morphogen-based principles in apex-to-base specification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Waldhaus*","__Linghua Jiang__*","L Liu","__J Liu__","R Duncan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706745600,"objectID":"77c5913acb2ecafc0389c960aa74c6fb","permalink":"https://jieliu6.github.io/publication/journal-paper/mapping-developmental-potential-mouse-inner-ear-organoids-single-cell-resolution/","publishdate":"2024-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-paper/mapping-developmental-potential-mouse-inner-ear-organoids-single-cell-resolution/","section":"publication","summary":"Inner ear organoids recapitulate development and are intended to generate cell types of the otic lineage for applications such as basic science research and cell replacement strategies.

T2D genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of signals in non-coding and β cell regulatory genomic regions, but deciphering their biological mechanisms remains challenging. Here, to identify early disease-driving events, we performed traditional and multiplexed pancreatic tissue imaging, sorted-islet cell transcriptomics and islet functional analysis of early-stage T2D and control donors. By integrating diverse modalities, we show that early-stage T2D is characterized by β cell-intrinsic defects that can be proportioned into gene regulatory modules with enrichment in signals of genetic risk. After identifying the β cell hub gene and transcription factor RFX6 within one such module, we demonstrated multiple layers of genetic risk that converge on an RFX6-mediated network to reduce insulin secretion by β cells. RFX6 perturbation in primary human islet cells alters β cell chromatin architecture at regions enriched for T2D GWAS signals, and population-scale genetic analyses causally link genetically predicted reduced RFX6 expression with increased T2D risk. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of complex, systemic diseases necessitates integration of signals from multiple molecules, cells, organs and individuals, and thus we anticipate that this approach will be a useful template to identify and validate key regulatory networks and master hub genes for other diseases or traits using GWAS data.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic risk converges on regulatory networks mediating early type 2 diabetes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__Z Zhang__","__F Fang__","__Y Qiu__","__J Liu__"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1685491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685491200,"objectID":"95ae4878a74e9dcb2e8ab5890caf4f56","permalink":"https://jieliu6.github.io/publication/journal-paper/epcot/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-paper/epcot/","section":"publication","summary":"Many deep learning approaches have been proposed to predict epigenetic profiles, chromatin organization, and transcription activity.

An increase in fetal hemoglobin expression throughout adulthood, a condition named hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), has been found to ameliorate hemoglobinopathies. Deletional HPFH occurs through the excision of a significant portion of the 3′ end of the β-globin locus, including a CTCF binding site termed 3′HS1. Here, we show that the deletion of this CTCF site alone induces fetal hemoglobin expression in both adult CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and HUDEP-2 erythroid progenitor cells. This induction is driven by the ectopic access of a previously postulated distal enhancer located in the OR52A1 gene downstream of the locus, which can also be insulated by the inversion of the 3′HS1 CTCF site. This suggests that genetic editing of this binding site can have therapeutic implications to treat hemoglobinopathies.","tags":null,"title":"3′HS1 CTCF binding site in human β-globin locus regulates fetal hemoglobin expression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Many deep learning approaches have been proposed to predict epigenetic profiles, chromatin organization, and transcription activity.

To establish the organ's delicate function during development and differentiation, spatiotemporal gene expression is strictly controlled by chromatin accessibility and cell type-specific transcription factors, jointly representing the regulatory landscape. Bulk-sequencing technology and cellular heterogeneity obscured investigations on the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin accessibility in inner ear development. To study the formation of the regulatory landscape in hair cells, we collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles accompanied by single-cell RNA data from genetically labeled murine hair cells and supporting cells after birth. Using an integrative approach, we predicted cell type-specific activating and repressing functions of developmental transcription factors. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility datasets, we reconstructed gene regulatory networks. Then, using a comparative approach, 20 hair cell-specific activators and repressors, including putative downstream target genes, were identified. Clustering of target genes resolved groups of related transcription factors and was utilized to infer their developmental functions. Finally, the heterogeneity in the single-cell data allowed us to spatially reconstruct transcriptional as well as chromatin accessibility trajectories, indicating that gradual changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape were lagging behind the transcriptional identity of hair cells along the organ's longitudinal axis. Overall, this study provides a strategy to spatially reconstruct the formation of a lineage specific regulatory landscape using a single-cell multi-omics approach.","tags":[],"title":"Mapping the regulatory landscape of auditory hair cells from single-cell multi-omics data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r08/2024 Dr. Liu received Endowment for the Basic Sciences Teaching Award 2024. link\n08/2024 Yicheng Tao\u0026rsquo;s CNTools work was published on PLoS CB.\n04/2024 Shuze\u0026rsquo;s work was published on Developmental Cell. link\n03/2024 The Liu Lab is a part of the new NIDDK project PanKbase. link\n12/2023 Our collaborative work got published on Nature. link\n12/2023 Congratulations to Fan who successfully defended his PhD thesis and will join Vanderbilt University Medical Center as a research fellow! link\n05/2023 Our paper titled \u0026ldquo;A generalizable framework to comprehensively predict epigenome, chromatin organization, and transcriptome\u0026rdquo; was accepted for publication on Nucleic Acids Research.

Wild-type Wdr5 or transient Wdr5 knockout promotes a distinct pattern of global chromatin accessibility and spurs neuroectodermal differentiation through an RbBP5-dependent process in which WDR5 binds to, and activates transcription of, neural genes. Wdr5 rescue after its prolonged inhibition targets WDR5 to mesoderm lineage-specifying genes, stimulating differentiation toward mesoderm fates in a p53-dependent fashion. Finally, we identify a direct interaction between WDR5 and p53 that enables their co-recruitment to, and regulation of, genes known to control cell proliferation and fate.

Cohesin is a ring complex composed of four core subunits and seven regulatory subunits. In an effort to comprehensively identify additional cohesin-interacting proteins, we used gene editing to introduce a dual epitope tag into the endogenous allele of each of 11 known components of cohesin in cultured human cells and performed MS analyses on dual affinity purifications. In addition to reciprocally identifying all known components of cohesin, we found that cohesin interacts with a panoply of splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These included diverse components of the U4/U6.U5 tri–small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and several splicing factors that are commonly mutated in cancer. The interaction between cohesin and splicing factors/RBPs was RNA and DNA independent, occurred in chromatin, was enhanced during mitosis, and required RAD21. Furthermore, cohesin-interacting splicing factors and RBPs followed the cohesin cycle and prophase pathway of cell cycle–regulated interactions with chromatin. Depletion of cohesin-interacting splicing factors and RBPs resulted in aberrant mitotic progression. These results provide a comprehensive view of the endogenous human cohesin interactome and identify splicing factors and RBPs as functionally significant cohesin-interacting proteins.","tags":null,"title":"Systematic proteomics of endogenous human cohesin reveals an interaction with diverse splicing factors and RNA binding proteins required for mitotic progression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data promises to enable scientists to interrogate the 3D architecture of DNA in the nucleus of the cell, studying how this structure varies stochastically or along developmental or cell cycle axes.

For instance, in genome-wide association studies, researchers collect hundreds of thousands of highly correlated genetic markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) with the purpose of identifying the subset of markers associated with a heritable disease or trait. In functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, thousands of spatially correlated voxels are collected while subjects are performing certain tasks, with the purpose of detecting the relevant voxels. The most popular family of large-scale multiple testing procedures is the false discovery rate analysis. However, all these classical multiple testing procedures ignore the correlation structure among the individual factors, and the question is whether we can reduce the false non-discovery rate by leveraging the dependence, while still controlling the false discovery rate in multiple testing.\nGraphical models provide an elegant way of representing dependence. With recent advances in graphical models, especially more efficient algorithms for inference and parameter estimation, it is feasible to use these models to leverage the dependence between individual tests in multiple testing problems. More specifically, we can use graphical models to explicitly model the underlying true states of the hypotheses as random variables to encode the dependence, and then model the observed test statistics independently given their underlying true states. We propose a multiple testing procedure based on a Markov-random-field-coupled mixture model which allows arbitrary dependence structures. In our model, the underlying true states of the hypotheses form a Markov random field, and the observed test statistics are assumed to be independent given the underlying true states.\nThis model requires more sophisticated algorithms for parameter estimation and inference. For parameter estimation, we design a novel EM algorithm with MCMC in the E-step and a contrastive divergence style algorithm in the M-step. We show that there is a lower bound of the log likelihood which nondecreases over the EM iterations except for some MCMC error introduced in the E-step. We use the MCMC algorithm to infer the posterior probability that each hypothesis is null (termed local index of significance or LIS). Finally, the false discovery rate can be controlled by thresholding the LIS.\nIn addition, we design a semiparametric variation of the graphical model which nonparametrically estimates the $f_1$ function \u0026mdash; the density function of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis. This is particularly important in some practical problems where $f_1$ is heterogeneous among multiple hypotheses, and cannot be estimated with a simple parametric distribution. The remainder of the graphical model is still estimated parametrically. The inference of the posterior probability and the false discovery rate control in this semiparametric variation remain the same as the parametric procedure. More important, this semiparametric approach exactly generalizes the local FDR procedure (Efron et al., 2001) and connects with the BH procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).\n","date":1505865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505865600,"objectID":"a73d743b2973a0781e57ce57acfff806","permalink":"https://jieliu6.github.io/project/multiple-testing/","publishdate":"2017-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/multiple-testing/","section":"project","summary":"A graphical model based multiple testing procedure which captures dependence among the hypotheses.","tags":["machine-learning"],"title":"Multiple Testing Under Dependence","type":"project"},{"authors":["__J Liu__","J Halloran","J Bilmes","R Daza","C Lee","E Mahen","D Prunkard","C Song","S Blau","M Dorschner","V Gadi","J Shendure","A Blau","W Noble"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"3f43b9512c2f252366033787ddf1397f","permalink":"https://jieliu6.github.io/publication/journal-paper/themis/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-paper/themis/","section":"publication","summary":"A comprehensive characterization of tumor genetic heterogeneity is critical for understanding how cancers evolve and escape treatment.

Lasso and its variants are widely used approaches to integrated learning and feature selection, and our methodological contribution is to incorporate the dependence structure among the features into these approaches. More specifically, we propose a new methodology by combining group penalty and $l^p$(1$\\leqslant$p$\\leqslant$2) fusion penalty to improve breast cancer risk prediction, taking into account structure information in mammography descriptors and SNPs.

In GWAS, we seek a ranking of SNPs in terms of their relevance to the given phenotype. However, because certain SNPs are known to be highly correlated with one another across individuals, it can be beneficial to take into account these correlations when ranking. If a SNP appears associated with the phenotype, and we question whether this association is real, the extent to which its neighbors (correlated SNPs) also appear associated can be informative. Therefore, we propose CollectRank, a ranking approach which allows SNPs to reinforce one another via the correlation structure. CollectRank is loosely analogous to the well-known PageRank algorithm. We first evaluate CollectRank on synthetic data generated from a variety of genetic models under different settings. The numerical results suggest CollectRank can significantly outperform common GWAS methods at the cost of a small amount of extra computation.

We compiled four unbiased phosphorylation site datasets, each for one of the four major serine/threonine (S/T) protein kinase families-CDK, CK2, PKA and PKC. Using these datasets, we examined several meta-predicting strategies with 15 phosphorylation site predictors from six predicting programs: GPS, KinasePhos, NetPhosK, PPSP, PredPhospho and Scansite. Meta-predictors constructed with a generalized weighted voting meta-predicting strategy with parameters determined by restricted grid search possess the best performance, exceeding that of all individual predictors in predicting phosphorylation sites of all four kinase families. Our results demonstrate a useful decision-making tool for analysing the predictions of the various S/T phosphorylation site predictors.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-prediction of Phosphorylation Sites with Weighted Voting and Restricted Grid Search Parameter Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["__J Liu__","S Kang","C Tang","LB Ellis","T Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1185926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1185926400,"objectID":"f69b949bad15ed906a79c97a529ed95f","permalink":"https://jieliu6.github.io/publication/journal-paper/meta-prediction-of-protein-subcellular/","publishdate":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-paper/meta-prediction-of-protein-subcellular/","section":"publication","summary":"Meta-prediction seeks to harness the combined strengths of multiple predicting programs with the hope of achieving predicting performance surpassing that of all existing predictors in a defined problem domain. We investigated meta-prediction for the four-compartment eukaryotic subcellular localization problem. We compiled an unbiased subcellular localization dataset of 1693 nuclear, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and extracellular animal proteins from Swiss-Prot 50.2. Using this dataset, we assessed the predicting performance of 12 predictors from eight independent subcellular localization predicting programs: ELSPred, LOCtree, PLOC, Proteome Analyst, PSORT, PSORT II, SubLoc and WoLF PSORT. Gorodkin correlation coefficient (GCC) was one of the performance measures. Proteome Analyst is the best individual subcellular localization predictor tested in this four-compartment prediction problem, with GCC = 0.811. A reduced voting strategy eliminating six of the 12 predictors yields a meta-predictor (RAW-RAG-6) with GCC = 0.856, substantially better than all tested individual subcellular localization predictors (P = 8.2 x 10(-6), Fisher's Z-transformation test). The improvement in performance persists when the meta-predictor is tested with data not used in its development. This and similar voting strategies, when properly applied, are expected to produce meta-predictors with outstanding performance in other life sciences problem domains","tags":null,"title":"Meta-prediction of Protein Subcellular Localization with Reduced Voting","type":"publication"}]
